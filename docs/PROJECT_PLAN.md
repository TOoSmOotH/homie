# Home Lab Management Application Project Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for creating a web-based home lab management application. The plan is organized into phases with specific tasks, milestones, and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Setup

### Milestone 1.1: Project Initialization
- [ ] Set up project repository structure
- [ ] Initialize Node.js backend project with package.json
- [ ] Initialize React frontend project
- [ ] Configure TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- [ ] Set up basic ESLint and Prettier configurations

### Milestone 1.2: Database Setup
- [ ] Design database schema for user settings and service configurations
- [ ] Implement SQLite database connection
- [ ] Create database migration system
- [ ] Implement configuration service with CRUD operations

## Phase 2: Backend Development

### Milestone 2.1: API Server Core
- [ ] Implement Express.js server
- [ ] Set up routing structure
- [ ] Implement authentication system (JWT)
- [ ] Create middleware for request validation and error handling
- [ ] Set up logging system

### Milestone 2.2: Service Adapters
- [ ] Create Proxmox API client adapter
- [ ] Create Docker API client adapter
- [ ] Create Sonarr API client adapter
- [ ] Create Radarr API client adapter
- [ ] Create Sabnzbd API client adapter
- [ ] Implement generic service adapter interface

### Milestone 2.3: Core Services
- [ ] Implement authentication service
- [ ] Implement configuration management service
- [ ] Implement notification service
- [ ] Implement scheduler service for periodic monitoring
- [ ] Set up real-time communication (Socket.io)

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### Milestone 3.1: UI Framework
- [ ] Set up React application structure
- [ ] Implement Tailwind CSS styling
- [ ] Create component library structure
- [ ] Set up React Query for data management
- [ ] Implement routing system

### Milestone 3.2: Dashboard Components
- [ ] Create main dashboard layout
- [ ] Implement service status widgets
- [ ] Create navigation and sidebar components
- [ ] Implement theme switching functionality
- [ ] Create responsive design for mobile access

### Milestone 3.3: Management Interfaces
- [ ] Create Proxmox VM management panel
- [ ] Create Docker container management panel
- [ ] Create Sonarr/Radarr management interfaces
- [ ] Create Sabnzbd management interface
- [ ] Implement real-time status updates

### Milestone 3.4: Configuration UI
- [ ] Create user settings management interface
- [ ] Implement service endpoint configuration
- [ ] Create application preferences panel
- [ ] Add backup/restore functionality for configurations

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing

### Milestone 4.1: Service Integration Testing
- [ ] Test Proxmox API integration with actual server
- [ ] Test Docker container management
- [ ] Test Sonarr/Radarr application control
- [ ] Test Sabnzbd download management
- [ ] Verify real-time status updates

### Milestone 4.2: System Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of all features
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Security testing for API endpoints
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### Milestone 4.3: Cross-Service Testing
- [ ] Test concurrent access to multiple services
- [ ] Verify error handling across all integrations
- [ ] Test fallback mechanisms for service unavailability

## Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation

### Milestone 5.1: Containerization
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for backend service
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for frontend service
- [ ] Set up docker compose configuration
- [ ] Implement environment variable configuration

### Milestone 5.2: Deployment Setup
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Document reverse proxy configuration (Nginx/Traefik/Caddy)
- [ ] Configure TLS at reverse proxy (container remains HTTP-only)
- [ ] Create backup and restore procedures

### Milestone 5.3: Documentation
- [ ] Create user installation guide
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create configuration examples
- [ ] Write developer documentation

## Timeline Estimates

- **Phase 1**: 3-5 days
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 1 week

## Dependencies

- Backend API must be functional before frontend development can proceed with real integrations
- Database schema must be defined before implementing service configuration storage
- Service adapters should be built before management interfaces in the frontend
- Testing requires actual external services to be available (Proxmox, Docker, etc.)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Service Availability**: Develop mock adapters for testing when real services are not accessible
- **Authentication Security**: Implement proper token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- **Network Failures**: Add retry logic and graceful degradation for service communications
- **Data Persistence**: Regular automated backups of configuration database

## Success Criteria

- All external services can be monitored and controlled through the web interface
- Real-time status updates are functioning correctly
- User configurations are properly persisted and secured
- Application is deployable via Docker with minimal configuration
- Code is well-documented and maintainable
